# battleship_game
Python project to build a simple battleship game


## The specifications of the battleship game:

The challenge is to program a simple version of the game Battleships (video). Create an application to allow a single human player to play a one-sided game of Battleships against ships placed by the computer.

The program should create a 10x10 grid, and place several ships on the grid at random with the following sizes:

1x Battleship (5 squares)

2x Destroyers (4 squares)

The player enters or selects coordinates of the form “A5”, where “A” is the column and “5” is the row, to specify a square to target. Shots result in hits, misses or sinks. The game ends when all ships are sunk.

You can write a console application or UI to complete the task.

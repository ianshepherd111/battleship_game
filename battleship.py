""" A battleship game to be played against the computer using the console

The computer generates the grid of targets for the player to shoot at.
and hides the ships for the game on another grid of equal dimensions to the target grid
The grid is 10x10 for the battleship game but for testing purposes the grid can be made other sizes
The following ships are placed on the grid at random with the following sizes:
1x Battleship (5 squares)
2x Destroyers (4 squares)
To fire at a target the player enters coordinates of the form “A5”,
where “A” is the column and “5” is the row, to specify a square to target
Shots result in hits, misses or sinks. The game ends when all ships are sunk.
